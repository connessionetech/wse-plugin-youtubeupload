# wse-plugin-youtubeupload
Uploads recordings to youtube account


**STATUS**: Project abandoned due to feasibility issues. Google requires audit of each project that uses youtube api to upload videos. That means every customer will have to take approval from google individually to havr the plugin post data to his/her youtube account.

## Note
---

The application codebase is inspired from old plugins at [WowzaMediaSystems github page] (https://github.com/WowzaMediaSystems)
